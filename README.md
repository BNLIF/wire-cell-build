Wire Cell
=========

This is the main "aggregation package" for building the "production"
Wire Cell software packages.

Wire Cell's home page is at

http://www.phy.bnl.gov/wire-cell/

The "production" packages are targeted for long-term, sustainable
development and use but are not yet ready.  Until then there is a 
working prototype version.  See above link for more information.

For installation instructions and other information about the
production version of the Wire Cell software see:
