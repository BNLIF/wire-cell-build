#+TITLE: Wire Cell Toolkit 

This package provides a "build aggregation" package for various Wire Cell Toolkit (WCT) packages.  

The home page for Wire Cell is http://www.phy.bnl.gov/wire-cell/.

* Installation

** Externals

The core of WCT depends on a few packages.  ROOT is needed for unit tests and some I/O related WCT packages.  

You may provide the necessary externals as you wish and various methods are outlined:

- [[https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-spack][Spack-based install]] automatically builds all (non-OS) externals and WCT itself
- WCT is built at FNAL as a UPS product named =wirecell=.

* Documentation

For now, the documentation is not keeping up with the code but it is in
[[./docs]] and at http://wirecell.github.io/wire-cell-docs/.
